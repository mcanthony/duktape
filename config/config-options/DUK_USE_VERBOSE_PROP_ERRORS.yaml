description: >
  Summarize offending base value and key for property operation errors
  such as "null.foo = 123;".  Keys and values are summarized using
  duk_push_tval_readable().

  The key/value summary includes string data which may be an issue for some
  security critical environments.  Disable this option if that is the case.
